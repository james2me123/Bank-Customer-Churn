# Bank-Customer-Churn

In this repository, I used Python to analyse a Kaggle Bank Customer Churn dataset.

The focus was to process the data for modelling and apply different ML algorithms to evaluate their performance.

Steps Include:

Analysing the features - understand / gain insights.

Feature Engineering - one-hot-encoding / standardisation

Oversampling

Cross-validation

ML Models:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-Learn)

Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Random Forest Classification (Scikit-Learn)
